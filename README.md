## What Is the Umm Al Qura Calendar?

The Umm Al Qura Calendar is a **calculated lunar calendar** adopted by Saudi Arabia
to determine Islamic dates such as Ramadan, Hajj, Eid holidays, and official
government records.

It is based on **astronomical calculations** performed for the geographical
location of Mecca, allowing Islamic dates to be determined and announced
in advance with consistency and reliability.

## Official Use

- Determining the start of Islamic months

## How the Umm Al Qura Calendar Works

A new Hijri month in the Umm Al Qura Calendar begins when specific
astronomical conditions are met, including:

- The occurrence of the astronomical new moon (conjunction)
- The moon setting after the sun in Mecca
- The conjunction occurring before sunset

If these conditions are satisfied, the following day is designated
as the first day of the new Islamic month.

This method provides a standardized and predictable calendar system
while remaining aligned with Islamic principles.
